## Purpose
This repository supports the Oglala Lakota Nation's bison habitat restoration
program by providing a reproducible, spatially explicit assessment of land
suitability for bison across the full Pine Ridge Reservation.

Bison are not just a wildlife management objective. For the Oglala Lakota,
bison (Pte Oyate) are central to cultural identity, food sovereignty, and
land stewardship. Restoring bison habitat to Pine Ridge is an act of ecological
and cultural restoration simultaneously. This analysis is designed to
support that work by identifying which lands are most ready, which need
investment before they can carry herds, and how climate change will affect
habitat capacity over time.

## What This Repository Produces
**Bison Habitat Suitability Index (BHSI)** is a pixel-level composite
score (0–1) across the full Pine Ridge Reservation, synthesizing:
- Vegetation condition and type (NDVI and NLCD land cover)
- Soil grazing capacity (gSSURGO)
- Topographic suitability (slope, aspect)
- Water access (distance to streams, ponds, springs)
- Climate stress (heat days, precipitation trends)

**Priority restoration units** are viable bison habitat patches identified
by DBSCAN clustering of high-BHSI pixels, ranked by composite score and
accompanied by a summary table of area, water access, soils quality, and
current land cover. See `docs/methods_clustering.md` for the full
rationale for this approach.

## Notebooks
| Notebook | Topic | Outputs |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Study area and data inventory | Pine Ridge boundary, data coverage map |
| 02 | Vegetation condition | NDVI trend, land cover classification |
| 03 | Soils and grazing capacity | gSSURGO grazing capacity surface |
| 04 | Topography | Slope, aspect, terrain suitability |
| 05 | Water access | Distance-to-water raster |
| 06 | Climate stress | Heat days, precip projections (MACAv2) |
| 07 | Bison Habitat Suitability Index | BHSI raster and priority restoration units |

## Data Sources
All data is downloaded at runtime and cached to `data/cache/`. Nothing
is committed to this repository.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/your-org/pine_ridge_bison_habitat
cd pine_ridge_bison_habitat

# Environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pine-ridge-bison
python -m ipykernel install --user --name pine-ridge-bison \
    --display-name "Python (pine-ridge-bison)"

# Launch
jupyter lab notebooks/
```

Run notebooks in order 01 through 07. Each notebook exports intermediate
results to `outputs/` that the next notebook loads.
